--How to run the cypress code
To run this Cypress automation project, first install dependencies using npm install. Then create a cypress.env.json file in the project root (this file is ignored by Git) and add your own email and password for testing. After that, you can run the tests in UI mode using npx cypress open or run them in headless mode using npx cypress run. Make sure not to upload credentials to GitHub—only store them inside cypress.env.json.
